Hello, my name is Nisona and I am currently just vibe coding my way around until I found a new big challenge.

I know the basics of HTML, python and some CSS. I'm best with learning by doing and therefore never really "studied" a language before (except HTML). But I'm open for learning whenever needed 👀

> So if you are interested in having me in one of your projects, reach out to me and I will be doing the best that I can.

I am also very interested in cybersecurity and Linux 🐧
